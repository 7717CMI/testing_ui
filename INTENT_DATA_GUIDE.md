# Intent Data Guide

## What is Intent Data?

Intent data reveals which companies are actively researching topics related to your healthcare solutions. By tracking research behavior across thousands of B2B websites, we identify in-market accounts showing genuine buying signals—helping you prioritize outreach, personalize messaging, and close deals faster.

2. **Intent Scores**: Quantify buying signals on a 0-100 scale
3. **Trending Topics**: Identify which healthcare topics are surging in research activity
4. **Buying Stages**: Map where accounts are in their buyer journey
